To accomplish this in the past I have used:
- Go
- Python
- C/++
- Assembly
- Copper Wire
- Optical Fiber
- Wireless (Radio)
- Bash Scripts
- App Engine / Elastic Beanstalk
- Cloud Functions / Lambda
- Heroku
- Microcontrollers
- FPGAs
- SAP Connectors
- EEG Probes

If you need something wired up to something else, let's chat and see what would be the cheapest, fastest, and most reliable way to get it done!
